Hello world!
My name is saurabh. I am a circuit design engineer looking to familiarize myself and be more comfortable with coding
This has been long overdue, and I am looking forward to correcting this gap in my resume
I am also hoping to unleash some of my creativity in the digital domain, hoping that, as I learn, I will be able to bring into reality (or virtuality as it is) some of the ideas that fascinate me
